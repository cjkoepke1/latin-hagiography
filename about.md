This website is meant to serve as an online repository for Latin hagiography from Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages, thereby making the texts freely accessible. These lightly edited digital editions are based on those published by the Bollandists in the *Acta Sanctorum*, a quasi-encyclopedic, multi-volume edition of Greek and Latin saints' legends first begun in the 17th century. As in the *Acta Sanctorum*, the texts are organized according to feast day although BHL (*Bibliotheca Hagiographica Latina*) reference numbers are also provided. The types of texts include passions, acts, lives, and poetry about the saints. 

More texts will be added over time.

## A note on spelling and punctuation

Classical orthography has been used throughout; *v* and *u* are distinguished while *i* and *j* are not. Names of persons and places are capitalized as well as the intial letters of sentences, but titles are not capitalized except in direct address. Otherwise, minuscule characters are used. Quotation marks are employed to offset dialogue.

Chapter and section breaks generally follow those established by the editors of the *Acta Sanctorum*.
